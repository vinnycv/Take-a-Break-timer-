Change title color when under a min

A second reset button to hit that resets back to your last set break and session
    e.g. you choose 1 min and 5 min for your times, you start a session, but
    you take long to get setup for your workout and want to just restart your 
    session really quick to 5 min. But reset will put break and session back
    to 5 and 25.
